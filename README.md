## FASTA sequence analysis
Author: Swathi Balachandran Nair 

## The aim of this project is to analyze a virulence related mRNA of the brain eating amoeba, *Nigleria fowleri* causing brain infection in animals and humans. Here we observe:
- Sequence ID
- Sequence length
- GC Content (%)
- AT Content (%)
- Reverse complement of first 10bp
The file is saved as a file named **fasta_summary.txt**.

## Here's how you can run this file:
1.Install **Python** and **Biopython**
2. Place your FASTA file ('sequence.fasta') in the project folder.
3. Run the script
4. Check the generated summary file 'fasta_summary.txt

## Here is list of files in the project folder:
1. 'fasta_1.py - the Python script
2.'sequence.fasta' - the input sequence
3. 'fasta_summary.txt' - the output summary


I have used Python and Biopython to create this project, NCBI to download the fasta file and git bash to upload the project to github.
